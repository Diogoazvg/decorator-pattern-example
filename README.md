# üöÄ Ruby Code Challenges Repository For Decorator Pattern

## Overview:

Explore a collection of diverse and well-commented Ruby code challenges, showcasing problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in Ruby programming.

## Highlights:

- **Forrmating Text Decorator:**
  - The application demonstrates creating different formatted texts by combining the base Text with various decorators.
  - The decorators can be stacked to apply multiple formatting options to the same text content dynamically.
  - In this example, the Text class represents the base component, and the BoldTextDecorator, ItalicTextDecorator, and
  UnderlineTextDecorator classes act as decorators. Each decorator adds HTML tags to the content of the text to achieve
  bold, italic, and underline formatting.

- **Buy Coffee Decorator:**
  - The application demonstrates ordering a regular coffee, adding milk to it,
  and then adding sugar on top of the coffee with milk. The decorators allow us to extend the behavior of the core
  component dynamically.
  - In this example, we have a Coffee class as the core component. We then have MilkDecorator and SugarDecorator classes
  that act as decorators. Each decorator adds functionality (cost and description) to the core Coffee class. The Coffee
  class itself remains unchanged.
